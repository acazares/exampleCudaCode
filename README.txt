In this repository there is cuda code that may help
one gain some knowledge on how to work on the GPU.
There are two directories which are vectorAdd and 
vectorDP. vectorAdd has code that works with vector
addition and vectorDP has code that works with the
dot product. The code can be profiled with either
nvprof or easy-nvprof that is found in the other
repository.
